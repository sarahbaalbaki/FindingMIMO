## AvGFP Log Fluorescence Prediction for Protein Sequences with various Mutations 

This repository contains the code and data for a project focused on predicting the log fluorescence signal levels of the Aequorea victoria Green Fluorescent Protein (avGFP) based on sequence mutations.


In this project, we explore the application of neural networks to a novel problem: predicting the fluorescence signal levels of avGFP in response to sequence mutations. Mutations in protein sequences, such as substitutions, insertions, and deletions, can significantly alter the protein's structure and function, leading to changes in fluorescence properties. AvGFP is particularly valuable in fluorescence microscopy, protein labeling, and biosensing due to its strong fluorescence characteristics.

Our goal is to understand the relationship between sequence variations and fluorescence signal levels to predict the approximate GFP expression level (log fluorescence level) for previously unseen sequences.
